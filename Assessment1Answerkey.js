"Write an example of how you would declare a variable (e.g. declaring a variable named EriqRulez)"
"(hint, delcaring a variable is just naming a variable you plan to use later)"

//Your answer goes here
let EriqRulez;

"Write an example of how you would initialize a variable (e.g. setting EriqRulez equal to true, assuming that EriqRulez has already been declared)"
"(hint, initializing a variable that has already been named is just giving it a value)"

//Your answer goes here
